## About Me

Hi and welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹

I'm a freshman student, in the progress of seeking a Masters of Science (M.Sc.) degree in Computer Science at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST).

My main technical focus revolves around computational intelligence, specifically multimodal generative modeling. Familiar with software engineering methodologies surrounding Machine Learning. Currently employing my knowledge to pursue a career in research in the fields of both bioinformatics and computational medical imaging. 

Looking to seek more experience in the domain of generative modeling in the biomedical fields, utilize my problem-solving skills in useful applications, and expand my horizons to new increasingly hot topics in AI through research and development. 

Learning is entertaining, and I'm always inspired to learn more :)

Feel free to reach out if you have any inquiries or opportunities, or if you would just like to have an enlightening chat!
